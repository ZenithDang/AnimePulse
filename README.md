# AnimePulse — Anime Release Trend Tracker

A multi-page dashboard for exploring genre trends, viewership, breakout titles, and studio output across anime seasons. Data is sourced from the [AniList GraphQL API](https://anilist.co).

## Pages

### Summary (`/`)

- **Tab Teasers** — three navigation cards at the top of the page linking to Genres, Studios, and Discover. Each card shows a live mini data preview: momentum bars (rising/falling % by genre), a top-3 studio leaderboard by avg score, and a top-3 hidden gem list (score ≥ 7.5, below 50th-percentile in viewership). Hovering highlights the card border in its accent colour.
- **Ranked Titles** — two-column layout showing the top 5 *Breakout* titles (most above their genre's avg score) and top 5 *Most Watched* titles (by AniList members) side by side. Each row includes a cover art thumbnail with rank overlay, score or member badge, genre pills (navigable to drill-down), and a delta or score secondary badge. Stacks to a single column on mobile.

### Genres (`/genres`)

- **Genre Trends** — multi-line chart showing avg score, avg members, or title count per genre across seasons. Each mode includes a dashed **All Genres** baseline. Toggle labels: **Avg Score / Avg Members / Title Count**. Toggle description updates with the active mode. Hover a data point to see the top 3 titles for that genre/season. Click a genre label to navigate to its drill-down page.
- **Genre Heatmap** — genre × season grid. Toggle between **Avg Score** (violet), **Avg Members** (teal), and **Title Count** (orange) modes. Score uses a fixed 6.0–9.0 scale; Members and Title Count scale relative to the current dataset. Click a genre row header to navigate to its drill-down page.
- **Genre Momentum** — bar chart showing % change per genre from the first to the last season in the selected range, colour-coded rising/declining. Toggle between **Avg Score**, **Avg Members**, and **Title Count**. Click a genre label on the Y-axis to navigate to its drill-down page.
- **Genre Co-occurrence** — chord diagram showing how often genres appear together across all titles in the selected range. Arc size represents a genre's total title count; ribbon width represents the number of titles shared between two genres. Hover an arc to highlight a genre's connections; hover a ribbon to see the exact pair count. Click an arc to navigate to that genre's drill-down page.

### Studios (`/studios`)

- **Stat tiles** — Studios Tracked, Top by Score (clickable → studio drill-down), Top by Popularity (clickable → studio drill-down).
- **All Studios table** — sortable by any column: Studio, Titles, Avg Score, Avg Members, Top Genre, Score Trend. Score Trend compares the first half vs second half of the selected season range (↑ / → / ↓). Click any row to navigate to the studio drill-down. Click a Top Genre pill to navigate to the genre drill-down.
- **Studio × Genre Matrix** — heatmap with studios as rows and selected genres as columns. Shows the top studios by title count in selected genres. Toggle between **Avg Score** (violet, fixed 6–9 scale), **Avg Members** (teal, relative), and **Title Count** (orange, relative). Hover a cell to see the metric value and up to 3 example titles. Click a studio row header to navigate to its drill-down page.

### Genre Drill-Down (`/genres/:genre`)

Per-genre detail page navigable from any genre label across the app.

- **Stat tiles** — Titles, Seasons, Avg Score, Avg Popularity, Best Season (by avg score).
- **Trend Over Time** — line chart with **Avg Score / Avg Members / Title Count** mode toggle. Score and Avg Members modes both overlay a dashed All Genres baseline for comparison. Toggle description updates with the active mode.
- **Score Distribution** — histogram of title score buckets for the genre.
- **Ranked Titles sidebar** — Top Rated / Most Watched tabs, up to 8 titles each. Click any card to open the detail panel.

### Studio Drill-Down (`/studios/:studio`)

Per-studio detail page navigable from the Studios table and Studio × Genre Matrix row headers.

- **Stat tiles** — Titles, Seasons, Avg Score, Avg Members, Top Genre (clickable → genre drill-down).
- **Trend Over Time** — line chart with **Avg Score / Avg Members / Title Count** mode toggle. Score and Avg Members modes both overlay a dashed All Studios baseline for comparison. Toggle description updates with the active mode.
- **Genre Breakdown** — horizontal bar chart of titles per genre; each bar is coloured by genre accent and the genre label is clickable → genre drill-down.
- **Ranked Titles sidebar** — Top Rated / Most Watched tabs, up to 8 titles each.

### Discover (`/discover`)

Hidden gem finder — titles with high scores relative to their viewership.

- **Score vs Popularity scatter plot** — log-scale X-axis (AniList members), Y-axis (score). Gem-zone quadrant is shaded; reference lines mark the active score threshold and member cutoff. Highlighted dots are coloured by primary genre and are clickable.
- **Controls** — Min score threshold (7.0 / 7.5 / 8.0) and Max popularity band (Niche 25th pct / Hidden 50th pct / Underrated 75th pct).
- **Gem grid** — top 10 gems ranked by a composite score (high rating + low popularity). Each card shows score, member count, season, genre pills (navigable), and a popularity deficit badge.

## Title Detail Panel

Slide-in drawer available from any title click across the app. Shows cover image, score, popularity, genres, synopsis, and a Viewership Breakdown section. The breakdown fires a single AniList statistics request on open and renders a segmented Watching / Completed / On Hold / Dropped / Plan to Watch bar with a colour-coded legend.

## Filters

All filter state persists across sessions via `localStorage` and is reflected in the URL — shareable links restore the exact view.

- **Season range** — select start and end season/year. Defaults to the last 6 completed seasons.
- **+ Current season toggle** — opt in to including the in-progress season. Off by default since incomplete data can skew scores and counts.
- **Format** — TV, Movie, OVA, ONA.
- **Top 50 / All titles toggle** — defaults to the top 50 titles per season by popularity (fast, 1 request per season). Enable *All titles* to paginate through the full season data (slower, multiple requests per season).
- **Genre multi-select** — searchable dropdown. Only genres present in the loaded data are shown.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app opens at `http://localhost:5173`. On first load it pre-populates with the last 6 seasons across 5 default genres — there is no empty state.

The layout is fully responsive. On mobile the filter controls collapse behind a **Filters** toggle button in the header, and the sidebar stacks below the charts.

## API Notes

- AniList requests are proxied through `/anilist-gql` — Vite handles this in development (`vite.config.js`), Vercel handles it in production (`vercel.json`).
- Adult content is filtered at the query level via `isAdult: false`.
- By default the app fetches only the first page per season (top 50 titles by popularity). Enable *All titles* in the filter bar to paginate through the full season. Both datasets are cached independently — switching back to Top 50 after a full fetch is instant.
- A concurrency limiter caps AniList requests to 3 in-flight at a time. Retries on 429 responses are capped at 3 attempts and honour the `Retry-After` header.
- React Query persists the cache to `localStorage` (24-hour TTL, key `animepulse-cache-v2`). Returning users within that window see data instantly with no network requests. After 10 minutes the cache is stale and silently refetches in the background.
- Genre list is derived client-side from loaded entries — the dropdown only shows genres present in the selected season range.
- Per-title statistics are fetched on demand when a detail panel opens, cached for the session. Closing and reopening the same title is instant.

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build        # outputs to dist/
npx vercel           # deploy to Vercel
